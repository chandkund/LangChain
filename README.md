# 🧪 LangChain Practice Project

## Overview

This repository is for practicing with core components of **LangChain**. Each part of the LangChain architecture—**ChatModel**, **EmbeddingModel**, and **Runnable**—is implemented and tested **independently** to understand how they work in isolation and can be combined in a full application.

> ⚠️ This is not a production-ready project — it's for learning and experimentation.


## 🧩 Components

### ✅ ChatModel

A simple implementation of a chat-based language model using LangChain's LLM wrappers.


### ✅ EmbeddingModel

Converts text into vector embeddings, useful for semantic search and similarity tasks.



### ✅ Runnable (Chain)

Creates and runs simple LangChain chains for testing prompt flow and outputs.


## 🧠 Goal

* Understand how LangChain components are structured.
* Practice modular development and testing.
* Prepare for building complete LLM-based pipelines.
